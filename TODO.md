# TODO

1. ~~Quick Add parsing:~~
   - ~~Support phrases like "every friday" and "every month" reliably.~~
   - ~~For monthly recurrence (e.g., "pay rent every month"), default due date should be today’s date and repeat same day next month unless edited.~~
2. ~~Project screen flicker:~~
   - ~~Project header and task list flicker between project name and another label; stabilize UI state.~~
3. ~~Browse menu:~~
   - ~~Two "Settings" entries; only one should exist and it should open Settings.~~
4. Recurrence visibility:
   - Decide whether to show next recurrence in Upcoming without completion (optional behavior).

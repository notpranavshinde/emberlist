# TODO

1. ~~Quick Add parsing:~~
   - ~~Support phrases like "every friday" and "every month" reliably.~~
   - ~~For monthly recurrence (e.g., "pay rent every month"), default due date should be today’s date and repeat same day next month unless edited.~~
2. ~~Project screen flicker:~~
   - ~~Project header and task list flicker between project name and another label; stabilize UI state.~~
3. ~~Browse menu:~~
   - ~~Two "Settings" entries; only one should exist and it should open Settings.~~
4. ~~Recurrence visibility:~~
   - ~~recurrence in Upcoming without completion should behave like this: the task should be shown in upcoming for the recurrence but on the day of the recurrence the task should not be added if the previous occurence is not complete.basically it should behave like it behaves now, and the upcoming window should just show the upcoming for visual verification purposes.~~
5. ~~Back Button~~
   - ~~There should be a arrow pointing back in top left of the screen when i enter a sub-menu, sub window that is not one of inbox, today, upcoming or browse~~
6. ~~support phrase "1st of every month"/"10th of every month", etc~~
7. ~~default for a task should all day, and not due at 9am(which is currently the case)~~
8. ~~Quick Add project suggestions:~~
   - ~~Typing # shows live project menu that updates each letter~~
   - ~~Keyboard stays open, menu closes on selection~~
   - ~~Cursor placed after inserted project name~~
9. ~~Task detail UI fixes:~~
   - ~~Task detail screen scrolls and buttons don't overlap~~
10. ~~Deadline parity:~~
    - ~~Deadline recurrence supported~~
    - ~~Deadline shown on task rows~~
